<h1 class="m-type-display-1">Ivor Scott Cummings</h1>
<p>As a Senior Software Engineer with over eight years of experience, I offer creative and technical solutions for web development projects. I specialize in Go and React, two of the most popular and powerful technologies for building modern and scalable applications. I also have expertise in DevOps, AI, and AWS, which enable me to design, develop, and deploy apps with efficiency and quality.</p>

<p>I’m open to permanent positions. I have worked as a freelancer for various clients, ranging from e-commerce to proptech, delivering web apps and microservices that meet their needs and vision. I have also published a series of articles on Go and React development, sharing my insights and best practices with the developer community. I enjoy collaborating with designers, stakeholders, and customers, and I always strive to learn new skills and technologies. I'm looking for challenging and rewarding projects that require a blend of creativity and technicality.
